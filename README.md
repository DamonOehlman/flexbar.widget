# flexbar.widget

A [Ã¼ebersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) system information bar (similar to [nerdbar.widget](https://github.com/herrbischoff/nerdbar.widget)) that is designed to work in conjunction with the [kwm window manager](https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm).

Very similar to those information bars, but with the intent that this information bar resizes well to different screen resolutions easily (uses flexbox rather than absolute positioning for system stats).
